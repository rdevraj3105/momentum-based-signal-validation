# Momentum Based Signal Validation
This project investigates whether momentum-based signals can predict future stock returns. Using historical price data (from yfinance), it constructs and evaluates momentum features, applies statistical and machine learning models, and tests predictive power over future returns.

(Built entirely in a Jupyter Notebook using pandas, yfinance, matplotlib, and scikit-learn)
